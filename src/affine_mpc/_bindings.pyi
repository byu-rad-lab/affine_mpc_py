    MPC formulation where only parameterization control points are optimization

class OSQPSettings:
    """

    OSQP solver settings.

    Most users will likely not need to modify the default settings, but they are
    exposed here for advanced use cases. See OSQP documentation for details on each
    setting.

    Note: `eps_abs` and `eps_rel` are the main tolerances for convergence.
    Tightening these can improve solution accuracy but may increase solve time.
    Defaults are usually sufficient for MPC applications, but can be adjusted if
    convergence is an issue. OSQP default is 1e-3 while affine_mpc defaults to 1e-6.

    Attributes:
        adaptive_rho: Enable adaptive ADMM step size.
        adaptive_rho_fraction: Fraction of primal and dual residuals to trigger rho update.
        adaptive_rho_interval: Minimum number of iterations between rho updates.
        adaptive_rho_tolerance: Absolute residual tolerance for adaptive rho updates.
        alpha: Relaxation parameter. Default for QP solvers is 1.6.
            =1: no relaxation (standard ADMM).
            >1: over-relaxation (can improve convergence in some cases).
            <1: under-relaxation (rarely useful).

            If iters is high, consider increasing to 1.6-1.8. If oscillations occur,
            consider decreasing to 1.4-1.5. Can also try 1.0 for standard ADMM if
            convergence is an issue.
        check_termination: Check termination conditions at each iteration.
        delta: Regularization parameter for linear system solver.
        eps_abs: Absolute tolerance for termination.
        eps_dual_inf: Dual infeasibility tolerance for termination.
        eps_prim_inf: Primal infeasibility tolerance for termination.
        eps_rel: Relative tolerance for termination.
        linsys_solver: Linear system solver to use (direct, indirect, or unknown).
        max_iter: Maximum number of iterations.
        polishing: Enable polishing of the solution, which performs an additional
            solve after convergence to polish the solution. This can improve
            accuracy near,constraint limits, but adds computation time. For example,
            if the solution is at input saturation, tolerances may cause the
            solution to be slightly outside the limits, and polishing can help
            ensure the final solution respects the limits more accurately.
            An alternative to polishing is to saturate the solution after solving.
        polish_refine_iter: Number of refinement iterations for polishing.
        rho: ADMM step size.
        scaled_termination: Check termination conditions on scaled residuals.
        scaling: Enable problem data scaling.
        sigma: ADMM regularization parameter.
        time_limit: Time limit for solver in seconds.
        verbose: Enable verbose output from OSQP for each solve, which may be useful
            for debugging. For general MPC usage, this should be false.
        warm_starting: Enable warm starting with previous solution.
